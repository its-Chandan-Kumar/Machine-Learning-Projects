# 💓 Heart Attack Prediction System

This project is a **Machine Learning Web Application** that predicts the likelihood of a heart attack based on medical data provided by the user.  
It is built using **Python**, **Streamlit**, and a trained **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)** model.  

The system helps users and healthcare professionals quickly assess cardiovascular risk using simple health indicators.

## 📖 Overview
The **Heart Attack Prediction System** takes several health-related inputs — such as age, cholesterol level, resting blood pressure, heart rate, and other diagnostic parameters — and uses a machine learning model to predict whether a person is likely to have a heart attack.

This app is fully interactive and runs directly in the browser through Streamlit.

## 🧠 Machine Learning Model

- **Algorithm Used:** K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)  
- **Model Files:**
  - `KNN_HAPS.pkl` — trained KNN classifier
  - `scaler.pkl` — `StandardScaler` used for feature normalization
  - `columns.pkl` — stores the expected column structure used during training
- **Frameworks:** Scikit-learn, Pandas, NumPy

The model was trained using the **UCI Heart Disease Dataset** (`heart.csv`) and tuned for balanced performance between sensitivity and specificity.
